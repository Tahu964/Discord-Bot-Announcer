-Discord integration: This whole plugin can be linked to a bot hosted on your server to give real time info on the game world. From the server becoming active to people joining and leaving, this gives you a simpler way of finding out whats going on without having to be there.

-Custom Death messages: Create death messages that spice up your survival world or use the default death messages to add some satirical humor to give you and your friends more to laugh about. Plus its all sent to your discord channel of choosing.

-Discord Promotions: Advertise your discord server to players joining the server. Or disable it with a simple command

-Death Counter: Keep track of all of you and your friends' mistakes in game or through discord!

-In-game commands: Ever wanted to tell your friends who aren't online to get on without having to leave the game? Now its possible to message your friends without having to hop on discord. Plus with the new built in clock command, reading time has never been easier.

-Discord commands: Died enough times because you joined the server at night? Now you can ask the plugin through discord to give you the current time so you don't get ambushed on spawn. Plus, you can message the server to tell your friends what's going on discord

-Configuration: Don't want people in discord blowing up the minecraft server? Adjust the plugin to choose the settings you want and the settings you dont!

This plugin was made possible using the Spigot development tools, JDA library, and countless hours spent on Spigot forums and stackoverflow (RIP my freetime). Credit goes to where it is due.
